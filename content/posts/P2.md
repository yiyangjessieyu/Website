In a world where perfectionism often paralyzes progress, this article draws inspiration from [Paul Graham's reflections on early work](http://paulgraham.com/early.html). It serves as a reminder that sometimes, we need to get out of our own way, silence our fears, and embrace the concept of launching a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

### The Fear of Early Work

Many people criticize early versions of projects for various reasons, including a lack of experience, skepticism, or prematurely judging them as complete. 


### How Can a Dash of Overconfidence Be Beneficial?


Graham suggests that "slight overconfidence armors you against both other people's skepticism and your own." It helps to slightly exaggerate the importance of your work and your role in it.

> "If you overestimate the importance of what you're working on, that will compensate for your mistakenly harsh judgment of your initial results. If you look at something that's 20% of the way to a goal worth 100 and conclude that it's 10% of the way to a goal worth 200, your estimate of its expected value is correct even though both components are wrong."

### The Importance of Your Peer Circle

Graham emphasizes the need for colleagues who can distinguish an ugly duckling from a baby swan. Surrounding yourself with individuals working on similar projects, as found in university departments and research labs, can be invaluable.


### Embrace the Fearless Start

Imagine a world where the fear of creating something 'lame' didn't hold you back. Imagine what you could achieve. This concept aligns with advice often given in creative fields: prioritize quantity over quality. I know I have a tendency to face a mental barrier when confronted with a blank page, striving for a perfect initial step, whether it's for crafting a paragraph in a report or making the first stroke in art. I noticed how this pursuit of perfection can hold myself back by planning deep into the future to create a perfect piece. Instead, I've been embracing imperfection just so I can produce something, not be feared by if this step leads to undesired results, knowing that it's through continuous practice and creation that we progress. I love leaving with valuable learning improvements for me to get to a masterpiece in the end. 

Reminds me of a story of an art teacher who instructed half their students to draw 100 versions of the same artwork and the other half to create only one. Which group do you think produced work they were prouder of?

Many of us struggle to respond positively to early versions of ambitious projects, tending to evaluate them against the standards of finished products. Graham urges us to view these early iterations as challenges to our imaginations.

> "The right way to deal with new ideas is to treat them as a challenge to your imagination â€” not just to have lower standards, but to switch polarity entirely, from listing the reasons an idea won't work to trying to think of ways it could."

> "The fear of making something lame holds people back in every field. But Silicon Valley shows how quickly customs can evolve to support new ideas. And that in turn proves that dismissing new ideas is not so deeply rooted in human nature that it can't be unlearnt."

### Reframe Risky Projects as Learning Opportunities

This advice aligns with the idea of enjoying the journey rather than fixating solely on the destination. Embrace the process, savor the act of learning, and remain curious. Don't be afraid to experiment and explore new approaches. Each endeavor, even if it seems 'lame' initially, holds intrinsic value. 

> "A lame-looking early version of an ambitious project truly is more valuable than it seems."

> "If the problem is sharply enough defined, failure itself is knowledge: if the theorem you're trying to prove turns out to be false, or you use a structural member of a certain size and it fails under stress, you've learned something, even if it isn't what you wanted to learn."

So, embracing early work and daring to release something less than perfect can be the path to innovation and growth. It's not about avoiding mediocrity; it's about evolving beyond it. Launching an MVP allows you to test your work's resonance with the real world early on, providing invaluable feedback before committing deeply to an idea.
