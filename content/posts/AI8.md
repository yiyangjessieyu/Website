## Web Scraping Methods
[This article](https://www.comet.com/site/blog/top-5-web-scraping-methods-including-using-llms/) provides breakdowns of the structure of HTML along with 5 web scraping methods:

1. BeautifulSoup
2. ScraPy
3. Selenium
4. Requests and lxml 
5. LangChain

Conclusions from experimenting with the above methods can be found on [my GitHub](https://github.com/yiyangjessieyu/Machine-Learning/blob/main/web_scraping.ipynb).


## Unit Testing Models

[Discussion](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/unit-testing-ml/) of the differences, challenges, and guidelines of unit testing machine learning code and models can be found here.
