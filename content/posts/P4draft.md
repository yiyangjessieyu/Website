### Key Takeaways

- Most people would be interested non-experts, so don't need to sell your project, instead work on giving them a little bit more insider information. 
- Provide contact information at end


Organize Your Talk
• Overall, follow the golden rules of presenting information:
Tell them what you're going to tell them
Tell them
Tell them what you told them

• Outline of a talk is similar to that of a paper to tel the story.
Introduce the topic, giving any crucial information for understanding the research area
O
Explain your data / what you did, and what results or outcomes you found
O
Summarize the most important conclusion(s) that you drew from your work
Discuss any implications or future work


Preparing Slides / Visual Aids
• Although the organization is similar to a paper, the presentation style is very different
Slides are not meant to be read aloud
Slides should convey ideas, not details
Slides are meant to present material in a visually appealing way
Each slide tvoically represents 1-2 minutes in a talk
• Limit the maximum number of slides to the total number of minutes in your presentation (minus title slide, references, contact information, etc.)
