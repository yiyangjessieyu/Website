### The Quick Dopamine Hit

One commonly cited reason is the pursuit of a quick dopamine hit. However, it's worth considering whether this is merely a myth. Dopamine isn't just about the immediate pleasure of a reward; it's also about the anticipation of that reward and the eventual result. Consuming more content leads to desiring more, perpetuating this cycle.

An interesting aspect highlighted in the video is how technology has brought people closer together despite physical distances. Paradoxically, it has also driven us further apart through the deep niches that algorithm-driven platforms enforce. 

### Our Agency

It's important to recognize that deep societal changes can occur, but as individuals, we can't change the entire system today. However, we have power - our agency. We can choose how we function within this system. Whether it's through meditation, disconnecting from the digital world, or other remedies - there's no one-size-fits-all solution. It may be challenging, but every day offers an opportunity to make a fresh start.
