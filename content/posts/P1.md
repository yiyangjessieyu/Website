### Key Takeaways

- Measure progress by weekly growth rates.
- Instead of asking, "Is this company taking over the world?" ask, "How big could this company get if the founders did the right things?"

### Focus on User Happiness

Manual user recruitment can be incredibly helpful, especially during the fragile beginnings of a startup. Early startups have less to lose when concentrating their efforts on their users. One advantage of being small is your capacity to be attentive to your users. 

Pay attention to the type of users who appear most enthusiastic and seek out more like them.

> "You should give users an insanely great experience with an early, incomplete, buggy product if you make up the difference with attentiveness."
This reminds me of how early Spotify aimed for top-notch UX and streaming performance, an experience completely unbeatable compared to Pirate Bay.

Aiming for perfectionism (although often tied to procrastination) can provide space to understand how users utilize your product. A top-notch user experience to captivate the user, followed by observing how the product is used, can lead to better understanding of user needs. This aligns with my understanding of how business requirements are important to be correct, so there's no rush to finalize software requirements. People likely want a more delightful user experience, making user satisfaction a solid goal to perfect (as seen in the Kano model below); however, there's room for discovery of what the user truly wants, allowing the user needs to be refined.

Similar to the image below, "Your user model may never be perfectly accurate because users' needs often change in response to what you build for them."

Engagement taken to the extreme involves "picking a single user and acting as if they were consultants building something just for that one user."

> "The feedback you get from engaging directly with your earliest users will be the best you ever get. When you're so big that you have to resort to focus groups, you'll wish you could go over to your users' homes and offices and watch them use your stuff, just as you did when there were only a handful of them."

Garry Tan pointed out an interesting trap founders fall into at the beginning. They want so much to seem big that they imitate even the flaws of big companies, like indifference to individual users.
