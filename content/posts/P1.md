## Key Takeaways
- Manual user recruitment can be helpful, especially during the fragile beginnings of a startup. Early startups have less to lose when focusing effort on their users. An advantage of being small is your capacity to be attentive to your users. "You should take extraordinary measures not just to acquire users, but also to make them happy."
- Pay attention to what type of users seem most enthusiastic, and seek out more like them.
- "Should give users an insanely great experience with an early, incomplete, buggy product, if you make up the difference with attentiveness" - reminds me of how early Spotify was aiming for top-notch UX and streaming performance that was an experience completely unbeatable to Pirate Bay.
- Aiming for perfectionism (although tied with procrastination), can allow space to see what the user uses your product for. A top-notch experience to hook the user in (super satisfied performance needs as seen in the Kano model below), and then observe how the product is being used to gain better accuracies of user needs. Aligns with my understanding of how business requirements is important to be correct so don't need to hone into software requirement so fast. People likely want to have a more delightful user experience, so this is a solid goal to perfect, however, there's room for discovery of what the user wants - therefore this goal can be refined. 
- Alike the image below, "Your user model almost couldn't be perfectly accurate, because users' needs often change in response to what you build for them." 
- Engagement to the extreme - "to pick a single user and act as if they were consultants building something just for that one user."
- Measure progress by weekly growth rates.
- Instead of asking "Is this company taking over the world?", ask "How big could this company get if the founders did the right things?"

"The feedback you get from engaging directly with your earliest users will be the best you ever get. When you're so big you have to resort to focus groups, you'll wish you could go over to your users' homes and offices and watch them use your stuff like you did when there were only a handful of them."

"Garry Tan pointed out an interesting trap founders fall into in the beginning. They want so much to seem big that they imitate even the flaws of big companies, like indifference to individual users."
