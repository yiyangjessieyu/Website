In this article, we delve into the research paper titled ["Dislocated Accountabilities in the 'AI Supply Chain': Modularity and Developers' Notions of Responsibility"](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/20539517231177620).

## Key Takeaways

In the complex landscape of AI development, striking a balance between modularity and ethical responsibility is crucial to ensure the responsible and sustainable advancement of technology in our society.

## How does the authors understand "responsibility" and "accountability"?

The authors conceptualize accountability as the "ability to critically analyze one's own social location" and the recognition of the impact of one's actions within the context of the AI supply chain. They were taken aback by the lack of accountability within the tech industry, where modularity often leads participants to perceive harm beyond their immediate scope of responsibility.

## How does the "many hands" problem influence AI developers to engage in more ethical analysis?

	
The "many hands" problem can encourage AI developers to delve deeper into ethical analysis by offering an opportunity for these diverse stakeholders to step outside their individual sections of the supply chain and act responsibly to prevent harm. Being part of a larger community of "many hands" can foster ethical considerations as individuals hold each other accountable. 

For instance, consider these two cases

1. Freely available open-source software, where access is granted only after users provide their email addresses. This practice facilitates communication among the various contributors in the product supply chain, creating a community that is more aware and proactive in regulating ethical impact. 
2. Additionally, an ethical reputation for a company can serve as a market differentiator. Concern for reputation and a commitment to minimizing ethical debt among the "many hands" in the supply chain can further motivate developers to address ethical concerns in AI development.

## How does the "many hands" problem influence AI developers to disengage with ethical analysis?

Software development often strives for modularity as it provides a systematic approach to breaking down large systems into smaller, manageable parts. This modularity approach simplifies complex hierarchies and reduces dependencies, enabling "many hands" to contribute to the project without becoming entangled in the details of others. However, this separation can sometimes lead to software developers overlooking the societal implications of their technology, including the potential harm caused by the underlying code. 

Modularity is essential for achieving scalable software, which in turn encourages the involvement of "many hands" in using these software components in the future. Consequently, AI developers may disengage from ethical analysis, believing that the ethical decisions of other stakeholders using their AI products fall outside their immediate scope of responsibility. 

In situations where there is a push to expand products to cater to a broader audience, the inclusion of ethical considerations can be perceived as a bottleneck, causing developers to prioritize scalability over ethical analysis.
