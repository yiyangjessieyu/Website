[How symmetry can come to the aid of machine learning](https://news.mit.edu/2024/how-symmetry-can-aid-machine-learning-0205)
- "Weyl’s law, conceived about a century before the boom in machine learning, had traditionally been applied to very different physical situations — such as those concerning the vibrations of a string or the spectrum of electromagnetic (black-body) radiation given off by a heated object."
- "Exploit a dataset’s intrinsic symmetries in order to reduce the complexity of machine learning tasks." Given a image detection algorithm, the complexity can be reduced as it doesn't need to fuss over how an object is being embedded into an image. Don't need to fuss over the object's position, "whether it’s exactly in the center or off to the side — and whether it is pointed right-side up, upside down, or oriented at a random angle. An algorithm equipped with the latter capability can take advantage of the symmetries of translation and rotations."
- Pros: Helpful when there is low training data.
