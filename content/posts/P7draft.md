Self-awareness and pattern recognition are vital skills when thinking strategically. We must pay attention not only to ourselves but also to our competition, basing our strategy on the assessment of the strengths and available resources. The ultimate objective of any competition should not be to destroy your rivals but to have an outcome that is sustainable.Also, don't forget to consider the needs and desires of your customers.

Only engage in competition that can create a win, without creating creating a loser that will keep attacking you. The key is to offer something unique to a specific set of customers, something that your competitors would choose not to do. 

Strategic thinking should also be reflective. It involves the ability to be self-aware, observant, and capable of learning from past experiences to make better decisions moving forward. 


### Leadership Interlude

A crucial aspect of strategic thinking is leadership. Leaders need strong people skills to connect individuals to a shared vision. This is vital for building a team and inspiring real action and initiative.

I believe that a leader is like the strong front bow of a ship, providing the team with clear direction toward the organization's goals.

### Can leaders admit they don't know something?

I acknowledge that leaders not knowing something may seem contrary to my previous statement about leaders needing a stable, strong direction. However, my answer is still a resounding YES.

In fact, I think it's essential for leaders to acknowledge when they don't have all the answers. Nobody knows everything, and it's why the willingness to learn and seek answers is what truly matters. Admitting a lack of knowledge is not a sign of weakness; it's an opportunity for growth. Leaders who admit gaps in their knowledge can turn to experts or other sources for advice. This eagerness to learn and find answers distinguishes an effective leader.

Therefore, a leader can maintain a strong center, providing stability and direction, even when admitting they "don't know something." It's the attitude of continuous learning and improvement that counts most. This mindset helps leaders guide their team with acquired knowledge, better judgment, and informed decisions towards success.

Leaders should be adaptable and resilient. Demonstrating hope in the face of challenges is a key quality for strategic thinkers.
