This post revolves around the topics discussed in the research article: [To Each Technology Its Own Ethics: The Problem of Ethical Proliferation](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13347-022-00591-7).


### Claim: There is no need to create multiple ethics as it's inefficient in ethical inquiry.

The claim is supported by the argument that "the conceptual boundaries between the subfields are not well-defined nor respected." New ethics often cover topics that overlap with each other, resulting in a duplication of effort. Therefore, proliferating the creation of more ethics often doesn't provide additional value, and there is no need to do it. In fact, there can be a risk for people to "ignore more fundamental ethical insights and truths" when they are creating more niche ethics.

For example, there are computer ethics, AI ethics, data ethics, information ethics, robot ethics, and machine ethics, each with its specific impact. However, additional ethics don't necessarily provide additional value, as the ideas are often covered through already established higher-level domains of ethics. The debate about robots and their capacity for human relationships often involves contributors who engage in ethical topics that may seem novel to them but simply reiterate arguments already dealt with in other disciplines. This results in very little forward progress despite the increase and duplication of effort.

This duplicated effort is akin to reinventing the wheel over and over again. By focusing on niche topics, it leads to reinventing weaker wheels* instead of looking at higher-level domains, their fundamentals, and thinking about improving basic concepts. 

>"Approaching a problem from different angles, or multiple times, is not necessarily a bad thing, but to provide scientific value, it should be purposeful and based on extant knowledge." 

>"Ethicists constantly reinvent the wheel, they could instead choose to rediscover and apply foundational insight from higher-level ethics. By doing so, they would be adhering to the scientific ideal of accumulation, and by standing on the shoulders of giants, they would arguably be able to get much farther into what is truly unique about their lower-level case studies.”	

The author's claim can be validated by contrasting the field of medical ethics with technology ethics. Medical ethics has seen significant advances by avoiding the creation of multiple subfields. Instead, medical ethicists share a common high-level "ethical goal — to improve the health of patients — and so the ethical focus remains the same across all subspecialties of medicine."

*Weaker wheels because each new niche topic is less established and makes it harder to find new valuable insights.

### Appeals to Autonomy, Harm vs. Good, Duties, Justice: Points Made by the Authors
The authors noted how there is an appeal to autonomy with principles related to autonomous technology design, where they strive for flexibility and aim to avoid "circumstances in which technological systems impose a permanent, rigid, and irreversible imprint" on individuals, businesses, groups, society, and the environment that technology can affect.
